 # ðŸ”¢**Guess The Number Game** -> [Source Code](number_guessing.py)
   
  **Guess the number** is a simple game where a *user* is supposed to *guess* the number that your *oponent*(the computer) has come up with.
  The program allows the user to set the boundaries within which a random number will be selected. It will then ask the player to *enter their guess*. 
  Each time you enter a number, *the computer will* tell you whether it is *lower* or *higher* than the *expected* number.
  
  You *win* the game when your *number* matches your *computer* number.

# ðŸ” **HangMan Game** -> [Source Code](hangman.py)

**"Hangman"** is a classic word guessing game. One player (the computer) **thinks** of a word (animal or fruit) and the **user** tries to **guess** it by suggesting letters one by one. Each correct letter is revealed in its position in the word. For each incorrect guess, your number of attempts decreases. The player who guesses the word wins by guessing it before the number of attempts runs out (the number of guesses is two more, depending on the length of the word).
