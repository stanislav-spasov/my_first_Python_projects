  ðŸ”¢**Guess The Number Game** -> [Source Code](number_guessing.py)
   
  **Guess the number** is a simple game where a *user* is supposed to *guess* the number that your *oponent*(the computer) has come up with.
  The program allows the user to set the boundaries within which a random number will be selected. It will then ask the player to *enter their guess*. 
  Each time you enter a number, *the computer will* tell you whether it is *lower* or *higher* than the *expected* number.
  
  You *win* the game when your *number* matches your *computer* number.
